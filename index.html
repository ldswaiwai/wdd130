            <p>Hello! My name is Gloria Lau and I am from Hong Kong. I live in Orem, Utah. I am a mother of 3 young kids. I love music and playing the piano. Recently, I read a quote "If you are trying, you are not stagnant." by Michelle D. Graig. I know that "He loves when we try to do something hard, because we turn to Him. He loves you, He loves to help and strengthen us."

            <p>The state is known for its skiing, with the mountains near Salt Lake City collecting abundant snowfall, as well as for the Sundance Film Festival, one of the world's premiere independent film festivals, staged each January in Park City.</p>
